# Diabetes Prediction
## Overview
This project is a Diabetes Prediction Model built using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical and demographic features.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing medical parameters such as:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
  
## Steps in the Notebook
- Data Loading: Import the dataset and explore its structure.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and data cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and distributions.
- Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Predictions: Testing the model on new input data.

## How to Use
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Satishnaidu2633/Diabetes-Prediction.git
```
Run the cells step by step to train and evaluate the model.
Modify hyperparameters and test different models to improve performance.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
